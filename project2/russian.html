				<h2>Production</h2>
				<p>
				The T-34-85 was a great tank for the soviets for many reasons. It housed a new weapon that could combat the German 88mm cannons.
				It was mobile, had average armor, and easy to produce. The predecessor of the T-34-85 was  “The T-43 shared, to ease production,
				a major part of its components with the T-34, including its 76.2 mm (3 in) F-34 gun. However, the tests performed at the Kubinka
				proving grounds showed that the T-43 did not have the required mobility (it was slower than the T-34) and, at the same time, 
				could not resist an 88 mm (3.46 in) shell impact.”(1) Early versions of the T-34 weren’t as effective as needed, so after the
				T-43s failure, the T-34-85 became the main focus. Furthermore since it was so easy and effective to produce, the “Soviet
				industry would eventually produce over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded as
				the war progressed despite the loss of tens of thousands in combat against the German Wehrmacht.”(1). Production of the
				T-34-85 ended in 1945 at the war’s end with a lot left over. They had the same method that the Americans had with their
				Shermans of just producing so many that they could overwhelm the German forces. Although for the russian the production
				of these T-34-85s was life or death since the battles raged in their front yard. 
				</p>
				<h2>Armor</h2>
				<p>
				The overall armor of the T-35-85 is actually decent due to its angels. The hull is 45mm of rolled homogeneous all around
				with the front having a slope of 60 degrees. That brings the armor value up to around 60 to 80 depending on the angle of
				the round coming in. The sides were also sloped but at a much less 39 degrees. Finally with the rear having a 49 degree
				slope for the upper portion. All these slopes really make APCR ineffective against this tank. The turret is 90mm in the
				front and on the cheeks as well has having a 90mm mantlet. The side section of turret is 75mm and the rear is 52mm, all
				of which are at a minor angle. The overall design of the T-34-85 is take advantage of angles to increase its armor effectiveness.
				Although APCBC or APC will still have an easy time penetrating this tank’s hull. One interesting modification about the T-34-85
				armor is “Apart from the turret, the hull was almost unchanged except for the turret ring. It had to be enlarged from 1.425m
				(56 in) to 1.6 m (63 in) to give a more stable and sturdy base, but this made the entire upper hull more fragile. The space
				between the huge turret and hull was also quite large and created natural shot traps.”(2). These “shot traps” are one of the 
				flaws to having the bottom  of the turret angled. When a round hits that angle and ricochets, it ricochets downward into the 
				top armor of the tank. That top armor is usually pretty thin and there for the left over energy of that round can pierce through 
				and inflict damage upon the crew. Typically if it’s just a solid shot then it would kill the driver or machine gunner, but if 
				its a round with explosive filler it could disable the tank all together. This is also one place where if HE was used correctly
				could be extremely effective.

				<h2>Armorment</h2>
				<p>
				The T-34-85’s armorment is substantial because of its 85mm and the ammunition types in its load out. The penetration values are 
				also very good and are almost on par with some of the German 88mm. Since the T-34-85 in every version has the same gun or just 
				an 85mm in general, each variety can be expected to perform practically the same. The ammunition types that are loaded out are the following:
				<ul>
					<li class="list">APHE “Armor Piercing High Explosive” shell is a very basic shell. It’s an AP with explosive filler, 
					set with a fuse to detonate once its made contact with the required amount of armor. This shell fares poorly at angles 
					because of its sharp nose because it will be more prone to ricochet. Once this shell penetrates the explosive filler would
					make short work of the crew inside. 
					</li>
					<li class="list">
					APHEBC “Armor Piercing High Explosive with Ballistic Capped” shell. This shell follows the same fundamentals as APCBC but
					has an explosive filler. One interesting fact about the T-34-85s APHE shell is that it has one of the biggest amounts of 
					explosive filler compared to its peers. 
					</li>
					<li class="list">
					APCR “Armor Piercing Composite Rigid” shell. This shell is purely situational because it has the best flatout penetration 
					values but with some serious drawbacks. The reason it’s penetration value is so high is because its shaped like a needle 
					and is also a solid material. The needle design is effective at flat surfaces but add a small angle and the chance of ricochet 
					grows exponentially. Furthermore if the shell penetrates the opponent it won’t do much damage. It won’t shrapnel as good as the 
					AP “Solid Shot”. What this all means is a longer time to kill. It would take a multitude of shots to completely disable a tank 
					which would give the opposing tank time to fire back or move. 
					</li>
					<li>
					HE “High-explosive fragmentation” shell. High-explosive shells lost their use during the war but the T-34-85 could still be 
					equipped with them. Due to the general increase in armor these low penetrating rounds with that exploded on impacted didn’t 
					do much against higher armored tanks. Although use for this round was found when light armor targets or infantry in dugouts 
					were present. 
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<h2>Overall Strength:</h2>
				<p>
				The T-34-85 stacks up as one the topic dogs against it components, although it isn't in the number one spot. 
				The armor and gun on this take made for a great pair and could dish out a lot of explosive damage while possibly bouncing shells
				due to its sloped nature. The Germans Tiger VI could still penetrate the T-34-85s hull under when in range but otherwise the
				front hull could sustain such a hit. Since the gun of the T-34-85 was similar to that of the 88mm it could complete when in 
				range as well. Furthermore it had great mobility and could provide one shot one kills, due to amount of explosive filler in the
				APHEBC or APHE. This is why the the soviets had one of the top contenders for WW2 tanks.
