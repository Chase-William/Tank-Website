				<h2>Production</h2>
				<p>
				The Char was an outdated tank in WW2 but was the best the french had at the time. France had a lackluster amount of good 
				designs for tanks and since WW2 was underway they needed to make something so they didn’t have nothing when they fought 
				the Germans. Therefore “Production started in 1935, with Renault building 182 Chars B, AMX -a Schneider subsidiary- 47,
				FCM 72 and FAMH 70. At 1.5 million francs apiece, it was by far the costliest tank ever built en masse. Consequently, 
				the original order of 1000 was reduced to 400.”(1). The production stopped in 1940 when France fell to Nazi Germany.
				Due to the poor design, a lot of armor was added to the hull and along with that came the weight of that armor. Hence
				this tank needed a big engine, big tracks to distribute the weight, and alot of fuel. Building this really reduced the
				spending power France had to put forth on other things. It can be concluded that absent production of a effective and 
				efficient tanks was one of France’s major downfalls in WW2.
				</p>
				<h2>Armor</h2>
				<p>
				The B1 had a lot of armor and was a huge tank with most of its armor being flat surfaces. This tank could definitely 
				bounce incoming shells to a extent but also has a massive weakness. The frontal hull of the Char has a multitude of 
				slightly vertically angled slabs of 60mm rolled homogeneous armor. The sides have 2 sets of 55mm armor with the first
				slab being connected to the hull and the second being spaced out to so that its positioned inside the tracks while 
				being outside the wheels and the drive gear that support and apply power to the tracks. With the side armor being 
				spaced like that, the frontal armor of 60mm also extends to inside the tracks. The interior 55mm slab actually is 
				hollow in the center because the tanks ammunition and fuel tank spread into that space inside the tracks. The rear
				armor is a flat 50mm that also extends into the tracks like the front does to make the interior space. The turrets 
				of the Char is oddly shaped while being 56mm thick all around besides a hatch in the back which is 38mm thick. The
				mantlet is also 56mm with the turret armor itself behind it to create an effective thickness of 112mm. Due to the
				massive metal plates on the sides and their spacing, made the front weaker than the sides. In an attempt to fix
				this “The B1 ter was a late attempt to radically improve the design. The main features were new 75mm (2.95 in)
				armor welded with slopes to the hull, a new 350 bhp engine to deal with this added weight (36.6 tons) and some 
				simplification in the design for mass-production in 1940, like the omittance of the Naëder transmission.”(1). The
				interior design of this tank provided the crew with a small amount of room. The whole back of the tank is taken
				up by the engine, fuel tanks, and transmission besides on the right side. The strangest thing is there is actually
				a walkway inside the tank with ammunition being stored on the floor and walls from the inside. The tank is still 
				cramped just because the front where all the actions are performed is very tight and close quarters. Which also 
				means any type of shell that enters the Char in the crew department will almost indefinitely injure or kill one 
				or more crew members.

				<h2>Armorment</h2>
				<p>
				The Chars main cannon is in a rather odd spot as well it being a short barrel which provide minimal time to achieve 
				a high velocity which is what provides accuracy. The armament consisted of “The machine-gun turret which was equipped 
				with an antitank 47 mm (1.85 in) gun. The main gun was a 75 mm (2.95 in) howitzer, in a low hull sponson.”(1). The 
				velocity of the 75mm was so bad that the penetration values of the 47mm were better therefore the secondary gun 
				had a better chance of inflicting damage to the enemy tank. Not even to mention it had a turret and could aim freelee
				while the 75 was limited to anything but what was straight ahead of the of tank. The ammunition types for the 47mm consisted of:
				<ul>
					<li class="list">APC “Armor Piercing Capped” shell. This type of shell is very similar to the  APCBC shot as in it has a cap
					to help with penetrating angles. APC has a solid blunt cap, not a ballistic cap. The Ballistic cap “BC” is to provide a
					needled nose to cut through the air until reaching the target where it then smashes away revealing the blunt APC round
					behind it. The APC just has a hard blunt head specifically designed to smash sloped armor but since the front is blunt 
					it loses effectiveness over range. This could be wrapped up by saying that APC is the poor man's APCBC.
					</li>
					<li class="list">
					The 75mm gun has the following shot:
						APHE “Armor Piercing High Explosive” shell is a very basic shell. It’s an AP with explosive filler, set with a fuse
						to detonate once its made contact with the required amount of armor. This shell fares poorly at angles because of 
						its sharp nose. Once this shell penetrates the explosive filler would make short work of the crew inside. 
					</li>
					<li class="list">
					Both guns on the Char have the following shot:
						HE “High-explosive fragmentation” shell. High-explosive shells lost their use during the war but the Char could still be 
						equipped with them. Due to the general increase in armor these low penetrating rounds with that exploded on impacted didn’t do much against 
						higher armored tanks. Although use for this round was found when light armor targets or infantry in dugouts were present. Since the Char has
						a 75mm, that gun could be used to take out infantry in a house or a dug in. Light armored targets would prove difficult due to its low velocity 
						and accuracy. Furthermore since it is mounted to the hull, it would be a extreme challenge to shoot an enemy moving at speed.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<h2>Overall Strength:</h2>
				<p>
				The Char is a really lackluster tank for its time. The guns it sported and the costliness of the tank’s production really dampen its 
				abilities. Being such a large tank with so much armor made it slow and cumbersome which made the German tactic the blitzkrieg even
				more effective. The 75mm is really useless with its low penetration values and limited range of fire. The 47mm doesn’t have enough
				firepower to do any considerable damage if any. This tank falls on the bottom of the list and would be easily squashed by its peers
				like M4 Sherman and T-34-85.
