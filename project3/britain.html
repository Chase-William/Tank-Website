				<h2>Production</h2>
				<p>
				When WW1 came to a close and WW2 began with Germany’s invasion of poland.
				British designers knew they needed to create a adequate main battle tank to rival the german panzer divisions. 
				Hence they created the Valentine’s first prototype in 1940 for trails and testing. 
				In 1941 “The Mark I set the tone for the entire series of eleven main variants, with many sub-variants, 
				and a staggering total of 8300 units.”(1). They closed production in 1945 because the war had ended.
				</p>
				<h2>Armor</h2>
				<p>
				The Valentine’s overall armor was lackluster compared to its peers.
				The armor layout was monotonous because it was the same all around with the Valentine’s hull sporting 60mm of rolled
				homogeneous armor as its frontal, sides, and rear. With a small portion having a slope on the front and rear.
				Therefore in those spots the armor added was decreased but the slope made up for that. 
				The turret was also 60mm all around but with the mantlet having 65mm. Most of the surfaces on the valentine where 
				flat or 90 degree angles which reflects poor design choices. The internal design of “The Valentine was of conventional 
				layout, divided internally into three compartments; from front to back the driver's position, the fighting compartment 
				with the turret and then the engine and transmission driving the tracks through rear sprockets.”(2). Having those 
				internal compartments is important because it provides protection from shrapnel if the tank is penetrated. It’s 
				important to have noted that all future variants of the Valentine had the same hull.

				<h2>Armorment</h2>
				<p>
				Early models of the Valentines had a 40mm main cannon until later in the war having them refitted with a variety 
				of new cannons. As the war became more surreal and realization of the power of Nazi Germany’s weaponry. The new
				Valentine variants began being fitted with a 57mm with even later models sporting a 75mm. All the different guns 
				had ammunition with different names but their type and how they interacted with armor was the same. The main ammunition 
				types include the following:
				<ul>
					<li class="list">AP “Armor Piercing” shell or a solid shot shell was a very basic design and also acted as a foundation for other 
					rounds to be created from. It’s was able to penetrate a fair amount of armor even on decent angles. Although a major 
					drawback to this shell is the damage it would do once it entered the tank. Equipped with no explosive filler, this round 
					would rely completely on shrapnel created from the penetration to inflict damage. Typically when this round was fired 
					from a Valentine it’s it would most likely take a few shots to kill or fully disable due to the size of the shell itself.
					</li>
					<li class="list">
					APCBC “Armor Piercing Capped Ballistic Capped” shell .This revolutionary round was design off the basics of the AP Solid Shot.
					It follows similar dynamics to the AP but was much better at achieving penetration. “The cap transferred energy from the 
					tip of the shell to the sides of the projectile, thereby helping to reduce shattering. In addition, the cap appeared to 
					improve penetration of sloped armor by deforming, spreading and “sticking” to the armor on impact and thereby reducing 
					the tendency of the shell to deflect at an angle.”(3).
					</li>
					<li class="list">
					HE “High-explosive fragmentation” shell. High-explosive shells lost their use during the war but the Valentine could still
					be equipped with them. Due to the general increase in armor these low penetration valued rounds that explod on impacted
					didn’t do much against higher armored tanks. Although use for this round was found when light armor targets or infantry
					in dugouts were present.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<h2>Overall Strength</h2>
				<p>
				The Valentine was an under gunned tank in the war and wasn’t very effective. Other tanks had better guns, better armor, even 
				access to more effective ammunition. It also wasn’t very maneuverable either, so it couldn’t flank an enemy tank or squad without 
				taking a considerable amount of time. Although it needs to be brought up that Britain was is an island so the need for a main
				battle tank wasn’t always present or desired. Against Nazi Germany’s Tiger VI, the Valentine would be outgunned and out armored. 
				Therefore the Tiger would have no issue taking down a valentine even from range. The USSR’s T-34-85 had less applied armor but 
				used slopes and was more maneuverable while also being equipped with more lethal ammunition. Overall the Valentine wasn’t a 
				completely bad tank but it wasn’t anything outstanding either.
