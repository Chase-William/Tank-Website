				<h2>Production</h2>
				<p>
				The M4 sherman was introduced into WW2 as Americans main battle tank because of its 
				easiness and cheapness to produce. As being one of the most famous tanks “This historic 
				status was gained partly thanks to its intrinsic qualities, but also due to the sheer 
				numbers in which they were provided, only surpassed by the Soviet Union’s T-34-85, with 
				a staggering 50,000 total delivered.”(1). Just like the British Valentine, there are many
				different varieties of the Sherman with the earliest versions being produced in 1941 & 1942. 
				Production of the Sherman stopped in 1945 when the war ended.
				</p>
				<h2>Armor</h2>
				<p>
					The Shermans armor was average compared to some of the opponents it faced. 
					Although most of the time the sherman didn’t bounce shells unless shot at the turret
					so most crews were rather lucky when it did happen. The frontal hull was 50mm thick 
					and up to 100mm on the heaviest armor variant the Jumbo. The Jumbo actually had 2 plates 
					of rolled homogeneous armor welded together with the inner one being twice thick as
					the outer. Furthermore all shermans had a 48 degree angle on that upper plate which 
					increased the effective thickness and chance for ricochet. The side armor of the sherman
					was anywhere from 38mm to 76mm depending on which variant. It’s important to know that
					the lower side armor behind the tracks is 38mm on every variant and only the higher side 
					armor above the tracks is where it was actually modified. The rear armor of the sherman
					is 38mm just like the lower sides. The turret armor on all the shermans variants is 
					actually pretty decent with the earliest model having a 50mm mantlet and then another 
					slab of armor behind that with 88mm of armor. Later models having anything from that 
					to 177mm mantlet and 152mm side and rear turret armor. For turret armor that was 
					outstanding for the time and really could give the opposition a run for their money 
					if the sherman was hull down. Being “Hull down” is where the hull of the tank cannot
					be shot and only the turret is exposed. The sherman’s interior was well designed with 
					“The main turret being roomy, enough for the three other crew members. The loader sat 
					on the left of the main gun and the gunner on the right, while the commander was at
					the rear, just behind the loader”(1). The hull was also spacious compared to other 
					tanks so if a shell entered the tank and if it wasn’t explosive, a lot of the shrapnel 
					might miss the crew depending where it enters.

				<h2>Armorment</h2>
				<p>
				Every sherman either had a 75mm, 76mm or a 105mm main cannon. Those were the only guns 
				shermans operated with and the 105mm was a low velocity, and low penetration round that
				shot primarily HE shells. The 75mm and 76mm were decent for their time but definitely didn’t 
				take the crown for highest penetration values or damage upon penetration. The main 
				ammunition types include the following:

				<ul>
					<li class="list">AP “Armor Piercing” shell or a solid shot shell was a very basic type 
					of shell and also acted as a foundation for other rounds to be created from. It’s was 
					able to penetrate a fair amount of armor even on decent angles. Although the major drawback
					to this shell is the damage it would do once it entered the tank. Equipped with no explosive
					filler, this round would rely completely on shrapnel created from the penetration to do
					its damage. When this round was fired from a Sherman it would take a few shots to kill
					or just one depending on where it penetrates. Assuming its the 75mm gun then since the 
					shell is decently bigger than the Valentines early 40mm, it will inflict way more damage
					with its increased amount of shrapnel. 
					</li>
					<li class="list">
					APCBC-HE “Armor Piercing Capped Ballistic Capped - Explosive Filler“ shell. This revolutionary
					round was design off the basics of the AP Solid Shot. It follows similar dynamics to the AP 
					but was much better at achieving penetration. “The cap transferred energy from the tip of the
					shell to the sides of the projectile, thereby helping to reduce shattering. In addition, the
					cap appeared to improve penetration of sloped armor by deforming, spreading and “sticking” 
					to the armor on impact and thereby reducing the tendency of the shell to deflect at an angle.”(2).
					This shell also has an explosive filler which is extremely deadly and was highly feared. 
					The way it works is once the shell impacts a certain amount of armor it triggers a fuse 
					which detonates the explosives. So once the shell penetrates it will detonate inside the
					crew compartment which is a extremely vile, but effective at removing tanks from the battle
					in one shot. It needs to be stated that this is where having no armor was an advantage because
					if the shell is set to detonate of the force of hitting 18mm of armor and you have 10mm.
					The shell will penetrate and pass through the tank without exploding or creating much shrapnel
					since the shell needs that friction and resisting force to inflict damage if the explosives 
					don’t detonate.
					</li>
					<li class="list">
					APCR “Armor Piercing Composite Rigid” shell. This shell is purely situational because it has 
					the best flatout penetration values, but with some serious drawbacks. The reason it’s penetration
					value is so high is because its shaped like a needle and is also a solid material. The needle
					design is effective at flat surfaces but add a small angle and the chance of ricochet grows
					exponentially. Furthermore if the shell penetrates the opponent it won’t do much damage. 
					It won’t shrapnel as good as the AP “Solid Shot” the Valentine uses but will penetrate
					thicker flat armor. What this all means is a longer time to kill. It would take a multitude 
					of shots to completely disable a tank which would give the opposing tank time to fire back 
					or move. Even though the sherman had a 75mm gun, this round wasn’t very effective at removing 
					their opposition because it gave the enemy chance to fire back when then revealed their 
					location by shooting.
					</li>
					<li class="list">
					HE “High-Explosive fragmentation” shell. High-explosive shells lost their use during the war
					but the Sherman could still be equipped with them. Due to the general increase in armor these
					low penetrating rounds with that exploded on impacted didn’t do much against higher armored 
					tanks. Although use for this round was found when light armor targets or infantry in dugouts
					were present. Since one variant had a 105mm and the 75mm or 76mm are still quite big, removing 
					light vehicles and dug in infantry was a possibility.  
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<h2>Overall Strength:</h2>
				<p>
				The Sherman was a great tank to mass produce and overwhelms your enemy in sheer numbers.
				It’s decent armor and gun set a standard for other nations to follow that had inferior tanks.
				It was also a maneuverable which proved to be one of its biggest attributes. Against its opponents 
				it could dish out some damage with its 75mm or 76mm but would need its numbers to be truly effective.
				Most of Nazi Germany’s tanks it couldn't penetrate from the front so it was imperative that it had
				the numbers to over run and overwhelm the German forces. But overall it was a formidable tank when
				you compare it to one of its ally counterparts.
