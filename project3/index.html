				<h2>My Topic's Exclamation</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this site is to choose the iconic main battle tanks from WWII and give some information about them. Different
				properties that define a tank like their armor, armament, shell types and ext will be explained in summary to help give an overall 
				feel of what the time must have been like. Interesting concepts will also be inserted to help make people more aware of how pros
				come with unexpected cons and vise versa. Overall the site should broaden the horizon of awareness for those who aren't knowledgeable
				about tanks and their properties.</p>
				<h2>My Background</h2>
				<p>
				The reason I made this site was because when I was younger I loved learning about how and why things worked. At a young age I played 
				a lot of video games. In the games I played I would test and analyze the AI’s behavior to find out how to complete my task the easiest 
				and most effective manner. As time went on I got into 2 games called World of Tanks “WOT”, and War Thunder. World of Tanks was the first 
				game to where I invested a couple thousand hours in. It is a multiplayer team based first person shooter where you are the tank. In this 
				game I would play different tanks on different maps facing different people and their different tanks. In all of this I fed that side of 
				me that loved the strategy and how and why doing different things would grant success or failure. Of course after reaching one of those 
				outcomes I would analyze everything that happened to create patterns and recreate the successful results through them. In the midst of 
				all this thinking and analysis my appreciation for tanks was born. This appreciation later on grew to eventually incorporate historic
				planes and their properties but playing tanks is where it all began so hence the website is about them.	</p>
				<h2>Content Organization</h2>
				<p>The layout of this site is quite simple as each page with its corresponding title will follow the same stack layout. The first element
				in the stack being production then, armor, armorment, ammo types, and lastly the overall strength to see how they compare to their peers.
				Armor will be a basic overview of the tanks main plates and its thickness and slope on all sides. The same goes for the armor on the turret
				and how the thickness changes around it. There will be an accompanying table for the armor values to offer readable content or armor values.
				For the armorment the main gun will be covered as well as its its secondary if it has one. If the tank has two guns they will be briefly 
				compared and then their primary uses will be discussed. Most tanks have several types of possible ammunition loadouts so there will be a 
				unordered list of them. The rounds properties will be stated and what kind of armor its designed for. Some of the interesting facts about
				the behavior of those rounds will be noted. Finally the tank and its properties will be summed up to be compared to its piers.</p>
