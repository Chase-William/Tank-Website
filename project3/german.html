				<h2>Production</h2>
				<p>
				The Tiger VI, one of the or thee best tank in WW2 for armor and firepower. Nazi Germany created the Tiger VI in a need 
				for an elite tank that could handle whatever the ally’s would throw their way. The Tigers were engineered to perfection
				so that they could always be reliable. “Tiger Tanks produced (only 1346), to the more than 120,000 T-34s and Shermans 
				combined, one can appreciate the psychological impact of this model, at least from the Allied tank crew perspective. 
				In its concept laid the very core of the German conception of a heavy tank.”(1). The production of these tanks was very
				slow and costly but that wasn’t a concern because they believed that quality > quantity. 
				</p>
				<h2>Armor</h2>
				<p>
				The Tiger’s armor is one of the best out of all the nations during that time. The frontal hull was sporting 102mm of rolled 
				homogeneous armor at 10 degrees which was impenetrable to many tanks. The upper side armor is 82mm and the bottom is 62mm 
				with the tracks adding an addition amount of armor along the sides. The rear is also a staggering 82mm thick with no slope. 
				Furthermore the turret is like the Valentines because it has 82mm all around the sides and back. The manlet is complicated 
				but ranges from 90mm to 200mm from various regions. That is a lot of armor and is exactly why the ally’s struggled to kill 
				this tank. Even though a lot of the tank isn’t sloped so APCR could penetrate, the round doesn’t do a lot of damage therefore 
				the tiger could fire back and kill.
				</p>

				<h2>Armorment</h2>
				<p>
				Some models of the Tiger had 75mm cannons but very soon after they were all fitted with the infamous 88mm. “The Tiger I gave the 
				wehrmacht its first armoured fighting vehicle that mounted the 8.8 cm Kwk 36 gun (not to be confused with the 8.8cm Flak 36)”(9).
				The 88mm could penetrate lots of armor from distance and became a notorious sniper because of it. The ammunition load out for the
				variety include:
				<ul>
					<li class="list">APCBC “Armor Piercing Capped Ballistic Capped” shell .This revolutionary round was design off the basics of 
					the APC Solid Shot. It follows similar dynamics to the blunt APC but was much better at achieving penetration. “The cap 
					transferred energy from the tip of the shell to the sides of the projectile, thereby helping to reduce shattering. In addition,
					the cap appeared to improve penetration of sloped armor by deforming, spreading and “sticking” to the armor on impact and thereby 
					reducing the tendency of the shell to deflect at an angle.”(2).
					</li>
					<li class="list">
					APCR “Armor Piercing Composite Rigid” shell. This shell is purely situational because it has the best flatout penetration values
					but with some serious drawbacks. The reason it’s penetration value is so high is because its shaped like a needle and is also a 
					solid material. The needle design is effective at flat surfaces but add a small angle and the chance of ricochet grows exponentially.
					Furthermore if the shell penetrates the opponent it won’t do much damage. It won’t shrapnel as good as the AP “Solid Shot”.
					What this all means is a longer time to kill. It would take a multitude of shots to completely disable a tank which would give
					the opposing tank time to fire back or move.
					</li>

				<h2>Overall Strength:</h2>
				<p>
				The Tiger VI is superior to all its peers with its armor and gun. The only bad things are in the production of the tank besides 
				the fact its mobility. Otherwise the Tiger will out range any other tank with penetrating shots and also out bounce any other 
				tank when it comes to incoming rounds. The Tiger VI could penetrate and one shot all of its competitors right through the frontal hall. 
				Overall the Tiger VI is unmatched with its ability to dish out damage while receiving it.
