			<p>
				I love having a cup of coffee in the morning. I use a mug I bought from Old Fort
				Niagara along time ago. I add about 3/4 of hot water and then add a spoon full
				of instant coffee. Once the spoon and the instant coffee are in, I add the creamer.
				Lastly I stir and remove the spoon so that I may enjoy my coffee.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Later at night I may have another cup of coffee. If I do its the same protocol as 
				earlier. I'll sip it while I play my video game and listen to chill music. 
				I Typically play a video game called War Thunder thats all about tanks and planes from 
				WW1, WW2, Korean War, and the modern day. I like it cause of its realism and I've
				always been a fan of tanks and planes. (Show me a picture of a tank or plane from WW1 or 2 and
				ill probably know, although I'm still learning)
